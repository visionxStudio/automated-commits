Hello there, 
I have created this workflow repository that creates a commit everyday. I made out this for fun to make my github contribution graph all **GREEN** but you can fork and use it for yourself too. 

## Using it for your own 
Simply, [fork](https://github.com/achyutkneupane/automated-commits/fork) the repository.
Go to ```Actions``` tab and enable the workflow action by clicking on the ```I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them``` button. 

![Enable Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30431426/177035472-243504fe-43ea-4748-9eb7-0a5833cd446e.png) 

From the workflows list, select `Automated Daily Commit` and click on the ```Enable Workflow``` button. 
![Enable Scheduled Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30431426/177035461-e745bbe3-39e5-4844-847c-966b2963b345.png) 

After that, edit the `.env` file. Set your name with `USER_NAME` variable and email with `USER_EMAIL` variable. 
Set `USER_USERNAME` to your username. Use your own username for ease. 

After you edit the environment file, **reset workflow** will run which will reset the streak to `1`.
